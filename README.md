# How to run 

Currently the frontend is my focus the api and backend is started but not completely functional


# Backend - create db and start up 

`python3 ./database/init_db.py`

# Frontend - client start up instructions

Open command line and cd in client directory

- set up node
I use nvm and there is a .nvmrc file for the project 
If you are just using node then you need to set up the version in the .nvmrc

- Run command `npm run dev`

- open chrome and go to  `http://localhost:5173/`
